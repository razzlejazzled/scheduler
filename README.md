# scheduler
The purpose of this assignment was to create a work schedule generator. You can save a string of text to local storage and have it repopulate next time the page loads. The color of the background also changes to show you what has already past, what is current, and what you still have to do later in the day. 

The site can be viewed here: https://razzlejazzled.github.io/scheduler/
